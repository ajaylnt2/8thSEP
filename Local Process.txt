Client Side Scripting:
---------------------
1. Open Node JS command prompt in Administrator level
2. Make sure it was at Project root folder
3. Check Node,npm installation status by using following commands
   node -v    ---> It displays the installed node version
   npm  -v    ---> It displays the installed npm version
   otherwise it will throw errors
4. If not installed install latest version of NODE JS
   "https://nodejs.org/en/"

5. After that use following command for npm installation globally
   npm install -g
   for reference check these links 
   https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-install
6. If the installation of all packages went fine it should show the node & npm versions
   when we check with option 3
7. Main thing to be safe in unblock by proxy level
   If it blocks during installation run following commands

   npm config set proxy http://10.9.17.5:8080

   npm config set http-proxy http://10.9.17.5:8080

   npm config set https-proxy http://10.9.17.5:8080
8. After that again run "npm install -g"
9. Install Gulp Server by using following command
   npm install -g gulp
10. Check gulp by using ----> gulp -v
11. If gulp installed it generates automatically a "gulpfile.js" at the project level
12. Then, run ---> gulp serve
    Hence, it starts the gulp server and displays the sucess message.
***Upto this we have done setting up NODE JS, NPM, GULP at project level***

Webpack-Server side scripting:
------------------------------

1. In CMD at project root folder run "gulp webpack"
   it will convert all client side files to server side(minified version)
   at a particular folder named as "dist"
2. If webpack command worked fine it should display after all conversions
   "Webpack Compiled Successfully"
3. Check the project folder and you can find "dist" folder with all minified version of project source
4. Then, change the paths of all configs which are serving by client to dist and check
   it should work asusual in case of dist
5. Then, the whole project will be equal to dist
6. Start local deployment(IIS) using only dist folder
7. Once it done we can replica this on Cloud side with some additional things.


It's not standard--It was based my work procedure in running local.
If it is helpful use as reference.
Thank U !

Same in VCODE if it not works go with CMD at Admin level---Best Way
